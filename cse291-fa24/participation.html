        <ul>
          <li><b>Come prepared:</b> Read and analyze the assigned readings carefully before each class session. This will help you formulate thoughtful questions, identify key points, and follow along with the discussions.</li>
          <li><b>Listen attentively:</b> Pay close attention to the speaker, both their words and nonverbal cues. Try to understand their main points, supporting arguments, and overall message. Take notes to stay focused and capture important ideas.</li>
          <li><b>Ask thoughtful questions:</b> Don't be afraid to ask questions! Well-formulated questions can spark deeper exploration of the topic, demonstrate your critical thinking, and encourage further discussion.</li>
          <li><b>Contribute to discussions:</b> Share your insights, connect ideas from different readings and guest speaker presentations, and offer constructive critiques. Build upon what others have said and keep the conversation flowing in a respectful manner.</li>
          <li><b>Be respectful:</b> Listen to others without interrupting, acknowledge different viewpoints, and maintain a professional and courteous tone.</li>
