        <h1>Student presentations</h1>
        <p>One of the students will present the assigned paper and lead
          the discussion on the paper. Each presenter will prepare an
          hour-long talk that will include questions for an in depth
          analysis of the paper and/or questions stemming from the
          paper. For classes that you prepare a presentation, you are
          not responsible for a critique. You are very much encouraged
          to ask the authors to send you their conference talk or any
          other slides they might be willing to share. Communicating and
          engaging with other researchers is a necessity. Augment the
          provided slides with strengths and weaknesses of the paper.
          Prepare discussion questions and insert them in appropriate
          location in the the talk. Please make sure to engage everybody
          in the discussion and feel free to ask question from the
          audience. Try to come up with new ideas and brainstorm those
          ideas with the class.</p>
        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>The oral presentations will help you to communicate and
          analyze your own and others' ideas through spoken words.
          Furthermore, we will develop new ideas during discussions.</p>
        <h1>Grading</h1>
        I will evaluate your talk and on a a scale on one to ten. You
        can earn a bonus point; however, most talks will receive a ten.
        I will allocate more point to slide preparation when the
        presenter does not have access to the authors deck.
        <ul>
          <li>4 points: Clearly presenting key ideas from the paper
            (teaching/explaining skills).</li>
          <li>1 points: Clear, well-organized slides (organizational and
            slide preparation skills).</li>
          <li>5 points: Stimulating interesting discussion (higher order
            thinking).</li>
          <li>1 point: Beyond my high expectations in some area of
            innovation, analysis, presentation, background, etc.</li>
