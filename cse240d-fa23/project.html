        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>You are required to complete a final project for the course.
          The project can be related to any of the topics discussed in
          the class. A strong project will demonstrate understanding of
          topics beyond the scope of what we covered in class. The
          objective is to develop a work that can be eventually extended
          to a conference paper. Innovation is valued above all and the
          second part is your execution of the ideas. As researchers,
          you should be to develop an idea to a submission and meet the
          conference deadlines. </p>
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>You can choose any of the following projects: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Come up with a new idea related to the course topic and
            implement it. </li>
          <li> Extend an existing paper in a new direction. </li>
          <li> Take one of the papers related to one of the discussed
            topics and implement the ideas presented in the paper. </li>
          <li> Take one of the topics covered in the class and write a
            survey paper, which discusses at least ten related paper. </li>
          <li>You are encouraged to use <a href="https://actlab-genesys.github.io/home/micro_2023.html">GeneSys</a> to implement
          your project to expedites the implementation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Collaboration</h1>
        <p>You are required to work in groups of two. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h1>Project proposal</h1>
        <b>You are required to email a half page project proposal to the
          instructor by the due date.</b> The
        proposal should convince the instructor: <lu>
          <li> What research problem the project is solving. </li>
          <li> Why this specific research problem is important. </li>
          <li> How the team will solve the research problem. </li>
        </lu>
        <p></p>
        <h1>Final Project Due date</h1>
        <p> Dec 15th 2023, Anywhere on Earth (hard deadline, not extension)<br>
        </p>
        <h1>Submission</h1>
        Each group should submit their report, proposal, and a link to the implementation by the Final Project Due date on HotCRP (not emails).
        <p></p>
        <h1>Final report</h1>
        <p>The project report should be in pdf format with no more than
          six pages of primary content using the <a
            href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sigplan-proceedings-template/rfvsrhgmghtc">ACM
            SIGPLN conference template</a> with 11 point font size. You
          are allowed unlimited space for the citations and appendices,
          starting on page seven, but your report should be complete and
          understandable without reading this extra material. You are
          free to use either the word or the LaTeX template. However, I
          personally prefer the LaTeX template. There are many helpful
          material on how to write a good conference paper on the <a
            href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sigplan-proceedings-template/rfvsrhgmghtc">ACM
            SIGPLAN author center</a>. I strongly encourage you to read
          the provided material. </p>

        <h1>Grading</h1>
        <p>Your project will be graded on a scale of one to 30 with ten
          points for the report, ten points for the implementation, and
          ten points for the presentation. If your work is ready to
          submit to a conference, you get 10 bonus points. In case of
          survey projects, the grade for report and presentation will be
          scaled by a factor of 1.5x. </p>
        <h3>Report</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> 5 points: Organized communication of the ideas in a
            conference paper format. </li>

          <li> 2 points: Clarity and grace, i.e., clear, well organized
            arguments in well organized paragraphs.</li>
          <li> 2 points: Empirical support for the proposed technique (4
            bonus point). </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Presentation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 points: Clearly presenting key ideas from the work.</li>
