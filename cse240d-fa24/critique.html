        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>Writing critiques and compare & contrasts (C&Cs) will help you develop critical thinking and teach you how to evaluate and extract deep understanding from original research papers.</p>
        <h1>Reading</h1>
        <p>
          You should expect to read for one to eight hours each week and to think and write for an additional hour or two to develop an interesting critique or C&C.
          Your emphasis should be on the innovations and insights that the papers provide and the avenues of new research that these papers pave rather than lengthy discussions of the experimental results and how the proposed work compares to the state of the art.
        </p>
        <h1>Submitting Critiques and C&Cs</h1>
        <p>
          Critiques and C&Cs are due at <em>11:59 PM PST the night BEFORE class</em> on Gradescope.
          If you are presenting and leading the discussion, submit an empty critique or C&C and you will receive full credit.
        </p>
        <h1>General Guidelines</h1>
        <p>
          Your critiques should not exceed two pages and your C&Cs should not exceed three pages.
          Both should relect on things you learned from the paper and the your thoughts provoked by the paper.
          While both contain summaries of the paper(s), the majority of your writing should be focussed on the key innovations and insights the paper provides.
          Please seek concision and clarity, and avoid unnecessary commentary.
          There is no penalty for shorter critiques or C&Cs, but there is a penalty for longer ones.
          Both your time and my time are priceless!
          Make sure that you use an active voice in your critique and C&Cs.
        </p>
        <h1>Critique Format</h1>
        <p>
          The following specific format is required for critiques.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with a paragraph or two that states the problem addressed in the paper, describes the proposed solution, and summarizes the insights resulting from the empirical study (i.e., a paper summary).</li>
          <li>State the strength(s) of the paper in one to three sentences.</li>
          <li>State the weakness(es) of the paper in one to three sentences.</li>
          <li>Include <b>two</b> of the following and discuss each in a separate paragraph:
            <ul>
              <li>What future research directions should be explored?</li>
              <li>What ideas or thoughts are provoked? </li>
              <li>What potential impact does it have on the field?</li>
              <li>Why will the paper be cited?</li>
              <li>What questions remain open?</li>
              <li>What experiments can provide deeper understanding about the work?</li>
              <li>How does it relate and extend the previous research?</li>
              <li>Why the work is not interesting?</li>
              <li>In which situations the approach will work or will not work?</li>
              <li>How can your own research be mixed with the insights provided in the paper?</li>
              <li>Other interesting analyses and commentary.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Add at least one question about the paper at the end.</li>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Your critique will be evaluated on a ten-point scale.
          You can also get a bonus point.
          Most critiques are expected to receive a ten with good insights and proper format.
