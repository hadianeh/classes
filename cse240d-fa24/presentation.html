        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>
          For many of the lectures throughout the quarter, a student will present one of the assigned papers and lead the discussion on the paper.
          The oral presentations will help you to communicate and analyze your own and others' ideas through spoken words.
          Furthermore, we will develop new ideas during discussions.
        </p>
        <h1>Format</h1>
        <p>
          Each presenter will prepare a 15 minute talk on their assigned paper.
          Then, there will be a 15 minute discussion/Q&A session; be prepared with knowledge of the paper outside of what you present.
          For classes that you prepare a presentation, you are not responsible for a critique or a C&C.
          You are very much encouraged to ask the authors to send you their conference talk or any other slides they might be willing to share; communicating and engaging with other researchers is a necessity.
          If you do receive slides from the authors of the paper, augment the provided slides with the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.
          If not, prepare your own slides as if you well presenting at a conference.
          Craft your presentation like an onion, with each layer of thought being peeled back as the presentation progresses to reveal the core ideas of the paper.
          Generally, slides should contain as little text as possible and instead be used as a visual aid to help explain the key ideas of the paper.
          Additionally, prepare discussion questions and insert them in appropriate location in the the talk.
          Please make sure to engage everybody in the discussion and feel free to ask question from the audience.
          If you can, try to come up with new ideas and brainstorm those ideas with the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only strict requirements for the presentation are that you must submit your slides to the TA (Christopher Priebe) by <em>11:59 PM PST the night before your presentation</em>.
        </p>
        <h1>Grading</h1>
        <p>
          I will evaluate your talk on a a scale of one to ten.
          You can earn a bonus point; however, most talks will receive a ten.
          I will allocate more point to slide preparation when the presenter does not have access to the authors deck.
