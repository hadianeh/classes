        <h1>Course Description</h1>
        <p>
          Deep learning is has revolutionized medicine, robotics, commerce, transportation and numerous other aspects of our lives.
          However, these impacts are contingent upon providing high-performance compute capabilities alongside restrained power consumption.
          Significant efforts have been made both by modifying hardware and software in the direction of enhancing the speed of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their consumed energy.
          The compute intensity of neural networks and the inability of general purpose processors to meet this high demand accentuates the need for domain-specific hardware accelerators that are custom designed for DNN computations.
          This course explores the design of high-performance, energy-efficient systems for deep learning, following a bottom-up approach.
          We begin by examining domain-specific hardware accelerators designed for efficient DNN computations.
          From there, we progress to learning techniques for optimizing and compiling DNNs on these specialized accelerators.
          The course then delves into the integration of DNN accelerators into larger computing systems and frameworks.
          Finally, we explore cutting-edge applications including Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Stable Diffusion.
          Throughout the course, you will analyze current literature in these areas and gain hands-on experience through a project-based approach.
          The course project will enable you to explore system design at whichever level you choose through the GeneSys (<a href="https://actlab-genesys.github.io/">https://actlab-genesys.github.io/</a>) framework.
        </p>
        <h1>Format</h1>
        <p>
          The course will be a combination of lectures, student presentations, and a project.
          The students will do a project in which they develop a solution built on top of the GeneSys framework.
          This project can be at the architectural level, compilation level, system level, or algorithmic level.
          For more information on the project, please refer to the <a href="project.html">project</a> page.
        </p>
        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <p>
          There are no pre-requisites for the course but students will be expected to be comfortable with a) basic computer organization, and b) programming in a language such as Python or C/C++.
          The course is open to both PhD and MS students.
          Undergraduate students require permission from the instructor.

        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
          Students will be evaluated based on the following rubric.
          For the details on each item please refer to its corresponding page.
        </p>
        <table border="1" width="100%">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Critiques</td>
              <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Class Presentations</td>
              <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Projects: Proposal, Presentation, Report, and Implementation</td>
              <td>40% (10% each)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h1>Course Material</h1>
        <p>
          There is no required textbook.
          All relevant materials will be made available online.
        </p>
        <h1>Academic Honesty</h1>
        <p>
          Students are expected to abide by the UC San Diego Honor Code.
          Honest and ethical behavior is expected at all times.
          All incidents of suspected dishonesty will be reported to and
          handled by the office of student affairs.
          You will have to do all assignments individually unless explicitly told otherwise.
          You may discuss it with classmates but you may not copy any solution (or any part of a solution).
