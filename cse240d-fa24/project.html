        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to complete a course project.
          The project can be related to any of the topics discussed in the class.
          A strong project will demonstrate understanding of topics beyond the scope of what we covered in class.
          The objective is to develop a work that can be eventually extended to a conference paper.
          Innovation is valued above all; your execution of the idea is next most important.
          As researchers, you should be to develop an idea to a submission and meet the conference deadlines.
        </p>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p>
          To enable students to develop complete and working projects in a timely manner, the only hard requirement for project ideas are they must be built on top of the <a href="https://actlab-genesys.github.io/">GeneSys</a> framework.
          The reason being is, because my lab developed the project from the ground up over the last few years, I and my students have a deep understanding of the framework and can provide support and guidance to the students in a way not possible with other frameworks.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Partners</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to work in groups of two.
          If you are looking for a partner, send a message in the "partner-finder" channel on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cse240dfa2024/shared_invite/zt-2r9jme7ae-OjqeM43eAF2sfB_Uq_c1_Q">Slack</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
        <p>
          This is the first place to start when thinking about your project.
          Before exploring any project ideas, familiarize yourself with GeneSys through the <a href="https://actlab-genesys.github.io/tutorials/asplos_2024">ASPLOS 2024 tutorial</a>.
          If you have any questions about GeneSys, reach out to the TA (Christopher Priebe).
          Once you have familiarized yourself, you can either come up with your own project idea or choose from the following list:
        </p>

          <li>Architecture-Level (talk to Hanyang)</li>

            <li>f-DFG Optimization using Equality Saturation</li>
          </ul>
          <li>System-Level (talk to Rohan)</li>
          <ul>

            <li>Potential Batching of Similar Search Queries to Improve Resource Throughput</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to submit a project proposal to Gradescope by <em>11:59 PM on 10/18/2024</em>.
          The project proposal can be in any format that you like as long as it is submitted as a PDF.
          I suggest including a timeline for the project in the proposal along with figures illustrating the proposed solution.
          Additionally, the project must include the following information:
          <lu>
            <li>What research problem the project is solving.</li>
            <li>Why this specific research problem is important.</li>
            <li>How the team will solve the research problem.</li>
          </lu>
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>Project proposals will be graded for completion.</p>
        <h1>Project Presentation</h1>
        <p>
          You are required to present your project to the class.
          The same guidelines that apply for the paper presentations apply for the project presentation (located on the <a href="presentation.html">presentation</a> page).
          To restate the important guidelines, the presentation should be 15 minutes long.
          Each presentation will be followed by a 5-10 minute Q&A session.
          You should present your project as if you were presenting at a conference.
          However, unlike the paper presentations, you should discuss your empirical results in detail along with technical details concerning your implementation.
          Be prepared to show code during your presentation.
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>I will evaluate your talk on a a scale of one to ten.</p>
        <table border="1" width="75%">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Clear Presentation of Key Ideas</td>
              <td>4 points</td>

        <h1>Project Report</h1>
        <p>
          The project report should be a PDF with no more than six pages of primary content using the <a href="https://www.iscaconf.org/isca2024/submit/isca2024-latex-template.zip">ISCA LaTeX template</a>.
          You are allowed unlimited space for the citations and appendices, starting on page seven, but your report should be complete and understandable without reading this extra material.
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
          I will evaluate your report on a a scale of one to ten.
          If your report is ready for submission to a conference or workshop (not in format, but in content; it should already be in the correct format), you will receive a 10% bonus to your final grade; this will be determined subjectively by me (Hadi).

        <h1>Project Implementation</h1>
        <p>
          You should demonstrate that your implementation works using both micro benchmarks and larger, potentially end-to-end, benchmarks.
          There are no hard requirements for the implementation other than it must be built on top of the GeneSys.
          Additionally, there are no hard requirements for the benchmarks you should use; reference the papers we have read in class for ideas or ask the TA (Christopher Priebe) if you are really stuck.
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>You will get a score between zero to ten based on the completeness of your implementation.</p>
